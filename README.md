# Survival-analysis: Lung Cancer Seer Database
- In August 2023, a client reached out to me for conduct survival analysis on people with Seer database
- The objective was as follows:
  - To determine the demographic and clinical characteristics of lung cancer in adolescent and young adults (AYA)
  - To determine Univariate and Multivariate factors associated with survival
- Data was cleaned partially with Excel and imported into SPSS where additional cleaning was done.
- Participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria (as shown in sheet 1 of the uploaded Excel file) were excluded
- Data was transformed to suit study objectives. After the data transformation, redundant columns were deleted to reduce file size.
